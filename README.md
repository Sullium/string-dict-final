# string-dict-final

My first GitHub repo.

The plan is to structure the project like the Linked List assignments. First we have a basic element class (Node in this case) which automates/abstracts the accessing of elements. Then we have an encapsulating class (SearchTreeSet) which contains and manages those elements according to called functions.
